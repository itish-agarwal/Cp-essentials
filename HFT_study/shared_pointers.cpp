/*

A shared_ptr<T> is a smart pointer provided by C++ that manages the
lifetime of a dynamically allocated object through reference counting.

When the last shared_ptr pointing to the object is destroyed,
the object is automatically deleted.

Reference Counting:
A shared pointer maintains a reference count, which tracks how many shared 
pointers are currently pointing to the same object.

When Are They Used? * * * 
Use shared_ptr when:

-> Multiple owners need to share responsibility for an object
-> You want automatic memory cleanup when the last owner goes out of scope
-> You want to avoid manual new/delete

Ideal for:
-> Graphs
-> Observer Patterns
-> Resource pools
-> Plugin systems

ðŸš« Avoid when:
-> You have single ownership â†’ use unique_ptr instead
-> There's risk of circular references â†’ use weak_ptr to break them

Shared pointers are suitable for scenarios where multiple parts of a program
need to access the same object and where ownership is shared.
